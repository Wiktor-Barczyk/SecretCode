Game rules: <br />
The first player sets a code consisting of 4 colors - the order matters, colors can be repeated (available colors: red (r), yellow (y), green (g), blue (b), magenta (m), cyan (c)). <br /><br />
The second player tries to guess the secret code: <br />
- He gives his combination of 4 colors in the correct order.
- The first player verifies the proposal and responds by giving the number of exact hits (the correct color in the correct position - the corresponding number of black circles) and hits that are not exact (the correct color in the wrong position - the corresponding number of white circles).
- The above steps are repeated nine times.<br />
- The game ends when the second player guesses the secret code or surrender.
